The  aim of this project is to automate the calculation of the necessary quantities to carry out the procedure outlined in [this procedure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5040656/), which is meant to assist in determining the minimum injectable dose required to produce diagnostic quality images.

## Dependencies

-pydicom: `pip install pydicom`
-skimage: `pip install scikit-image`
-pandas: `pip install pandas`

                                   
## Getting Started ##

Take a look at [this tutorial](./NemaRC_tutorial.ipynb) to see how our analysis can be applied to a single PET scan of the image quality phantom.
